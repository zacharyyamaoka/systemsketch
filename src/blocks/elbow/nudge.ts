/**
 * Channel assignment ("nudging") for a bundle of elbow cables.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `routeElbow` is pure and routes **one** cable at a time. That is the right
 * seam — but it means two cables between the same pair of blocks are computed
 * in total ignorance of each other, and both pick the same corridor. Measured
 * on a two-block scene with two parallel cables, the real router returns:
 *
 *   out_1 -> in_1 : (320,150) (460,150) (460,  0) (600,  0)
 *   out_2 -> in_2 : (320,185) (460,185) (460, 35) (600, 35)
 *
 * Both verticals sit at x = 460.0 — the midline between the boxes — and their
 * spans [0,150] and [35,185] overlap for 115 px. Two cables, one visible line.
 * This is not an edge case: the midline is deterministic, so *every* parallel
 * pair between the same two blocks collides, always.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *
 * Given the already-routed cables, find interior segments that are collinear
 * and overlapping, then spread them across distinct parallel channels. The
 * order they are spread in is not arbitrary: it is chosen so that the spread
 * introduces **no new crossings**, and — in the common case — removes the ones
 * the shared channel was creating.
 *
 * The ordering rule falls out of the geometry. For a vertical segment V_i at
 * x = c_i spanning (lo_i, hi_i), with a horizontal arriving from the left and
 * another leaving to the right:
 *
 *   • if another cable's *arriving* horizontal sits at a y strictly inside
 *     V_i's span, that cable must be routed LEFT of i, else it cuts V_i;
 *   • if another cable's *leaving* horizontal sits at a y strictly inside
 *     V_i's span, that cable must be routed RIGHT of i.
 *
 * Those pairwise "must be left of" facts form a graph. A topological order of
 * it is a crossing-free channel assignment. A **cycle** in it is a crossing
 * that no channel assignment can remove — the connection order genuinely
 * inverts — and that, precisely, is where a crossover hop earns its keep.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PROVENANCE, AND HOW THIS COMPARES TO THE REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATIONS
 *
 * This is NOT a port of anything. The ordering rule above was derived from the
 * geometry directly; the implementations below were read afterwards to check it.
 * That matters legally as well as intellectually: libavoid and its TypeScript
 * port `obstacle-router` are **LGPL**, which is not an attribution licence — a
 * credit in a comment would not discharge it — so neither was read. Everything
 * cited here is MIT, Apache-2.0 or EPL-2.0.
 *
 * The lineage is the vertical-constraint graph of VLSI channel routing
 * (Hashimoto & Stevens' left-edge algorithm, 1971). Three modern relatives:
 *
 * - **ELK** (`OrthogonalRoutingGenerator.java`, EPL-2.0) builds a conflict DAG
 *   between parallel runs and assigns each a `routingSlot` by Kahn's algorithm
 *   with `slot = max(current, source.slot + 1)`. That is structurally what
 *   `orderBundle` does. ELK *weights* its conflicts (crossings cost 16x a
 *   conflict) and picks the cheaper of the two orderings; we use hard
 *   constraints and report the cycle instead, because a cycle is exactly the
 *   "no assignment can fix this" answer the caller wants.
 *
 * - **MSAGL-js** (`CombinatorialNudger.ts`, MIT, Microsoft Research) orders two
 *   paths sharing a track by walking BOTH of them forward — and then backward —
 *   until they diverge at a fork, and comparing the projection of the fork
 *   points. Ours is the **depth-1 specialisation** of that walk: we compare the
 *   immediately adjacent legs rather than following the paths to their fork.
 *   For cables between two blocks the paths diverge immediately, so depth 1 IS
 *   the fork and the two rules agree. Verified further out too: with an obstacle
 *   forcing 6-point routes and three separate shared channels, this pass still
 *   reaches zero overlap and zero crossings, and correctly *inverts* the order
 *   between the first and last channel (see `nudge.test.ts`).
 *
 *   Where they genuinely differ is two cables sharing *consecutive* segments —
 *   truly coincident sub-paths. Depth 1 has no information there and falls back
 *   to the tie-break. Note the canonical algorithm concedes the same case:
 *   Pupyrev et al. state that "pairs of coincident paths ... are ordered
 *   arbitrarily on the edge".
 *
 * - **Mermaid** (`orthogonalRouter`, MIT) groups segments into `Track`s and
 *   offsets them at fixed `TRACK_SPACING` increments, leaning each track left or
 *   right by where its destinations sit. Closest in spirit to this file. MSAGL
 *   instead feeds the ordering to a real 1-D constraint solver, which buys
 *   variable spacing in crowded channels — the obvious upgrade path here if
 *   fixed `spacing` ever proves too rigid.
 *
 * Nothing here imports tldraw, React or the app. Same contract as the rest of
 * this folder: pure in, pure out, provable.
