/**
 * Pins — the persisted form of "the user dragged this bend".
 *
 * ## Why not Excalidraw's `fixedSegments`
 *
 * Excalidraw stores a dragged segment as a pair of **element-local absolute
 * points** (`FixedSegment = { start: LocalPoint; end: LocalPoint; index }`,
 * `packages/element/src/types.ts:349`). Element-local means "relative to the
 * arrow's own bounding box origin", and the arrow's origin is recomputed from
 * its points — so when one endpoint moves, a fixed segment stays where it was on
 * the canvas and the route re-solves around it. That is precisely the behaviour
 * Zach rejected:
 *
 * > "When I drag the box, the arrow elbow stays in the same place. This is not
 * > desirable. Dragging the box should drag everything inside frozen in place."
 *
 * So a pyblocks pin stores **one scalar in the frame spanned by the two
 * endpoints**, never an absolute coordinate:
 *
 * ```
 * value = mid + (t - 0.5) * span + offset
 *   where  span = end[cross] - start[cross]
 *          mid  = (start[cross] + end[cross]) / 2
 * ```
 *
 * - Translate **both** endpoints by `d` → `mid` moves by `d`, `span` is
 *   unchanged → the bend moves by exactly `d`. Frozen in place, which is the
 *   multi-select drag case.
 * - Translate **one** endpoint by `d` → the bend moves by `t * d`, i.e. it keeps
 *   its proportional place in the gap and the route stays sane.
 * - `span → 0` → the `(t - 0.5) * span` term vanishes on its own, so there is no
 *   blow-up and no discontinuity; `offset` (captured only when the span was
 *   already degenerate at pin time) carries the pin instead.
