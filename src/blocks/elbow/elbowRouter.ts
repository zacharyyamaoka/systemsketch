 * THIRD-PARTY NOTICE

 * The routing core below — the dynamic keep-out boxes, the non-uniform grid,
 * the A* search with its bend penalty and its remaining-bend heuristic — is
 * ported from Excalidraw, MIT licensed, Copyright (c) 2020 Excalidraw.
 *
 *   upstream file: https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/blob/e1bb9ff8f8931e783c11d104abb8967ac6605c9a/packages/element/src/elbowArrow.ts
 *   revision:      e1bb9ff8f8931e783c11d104abb8967ac6605c9a  (master, fetched 2026-08-26)
 *
 * The full MIT permission notice travels with this repository in
 * `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Ported functions are marked `@ported` with their
 * upstream name; everything else here is pyblocks' own.
 *
 * Excalidraw is copied rather than depended on: its published packages carry no
 * semver (`@excalidraw/element@latest` resolves to a commit-hashed build such as
 * `0.18.0-f0063e113`) and `@excalidraw/math` does not publish the `./ellipse`
 * subpath that `@excalidraw/element` imports, so the dependency does not install
 * cleanly in the first place.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * tldraw's own elbow arrows cannot do this. `arrowKinds = ['arc', 'elbow']`
 * (`@tldraw/tlschema/src/shapes/TLArrowShape.ts:21`) and the whole elbow route
 * is steered by a single scalar `elbowMidPoint` (`:176`, default `0.5` at
 * `tldraw/src/lib/shapes/arrow/ArrowShapeUtil.tsx:245`). The arrow exposes
 * exactly three handle ids — `start`, `middle`, `end` (`:84-88`) — and the elbow
 * branch of `getHandles` pushes **at most one** `middle` handle, guarded by
 * `info.route.midpointHandle` which is typed `ElbowArrowMidpointHandle | null`
 * (`elbow/definitions.ts:56`). So: one bend, one scalar, one handle. Everything
 * in this folder exists because that is not enough.
