/**
 * Where a routed path meets the edge of a box — the general form of "put the
 * derived port wherever the cable crosses the boundary".
 *
 * This is deliberately not about mutations. Any time something is derived from
 * a cable's relationship to an enclosing rectangle, it needs the same answer:
 *
 *  * a side-effect port, which appears where an effect cable leaves its block
 *    or its enclosing frame, and moves when you drag the cable;
 *  * a group or frame boundary port, for a cable that crosses in or out of a
 *    collapsed group;
 *  * a tunnel entry on a Branch region or a loop band;
 *  * a badge, label or clip marker placed where a cable enters a container.
 *
 * So it takes a rectangle and a polyline and answers three things: which side
 * was crossed, exactly where, and how far along the path that happened. It does
 * not know what the caller intends to put there.
 *
 * Pure geometry: no tldraw, no React, no DOM, no runtime deps, same as the rest
 * of `src/blocks/elbow/`. Segments may be diagonal — the clipper is Liang–Barsky,
 * so a curve flattened to a polyline works as well as an orthogonal route.
 *
 * ## Conventions
 *
 * A point exactly on the boundary counts as *on*, not outside: a cable that
 * starts on a block's top edge and runs upward exits at its own first point,
 * at `t = 0`, which is what makes "the port sits where the stub leaves" fall
 * out with no special case. A segment that runs *along* an edge never leaves,
 * so it produces no crossing.
