/**
 * The before/after pair a primitive carries, and what a changed pose means.
 *
 * The board diff contract already emits exactly what round 2 needs — every
 * `Change` carries `fields: [{ path, before, after }]` — and round 1 simply did
 * not consume it. It kept one coarse `state` enum per primitive plus a single
 * bespoke `stateBefore` string on a port, which is why the only field in the
 * whole product that could render `old → new` was a port's name, and why every
 * other field could do nothing louder than a strike.
 *
 * So a primitive now carries the contract's own triple, unchanged, and the
 * display reads it. A new diffable field costs zero schema.
 *
 * Geometry is deliberately NOT in that array. `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` are numbers
 * whose mark is an outline rather than a word-diff, and stringifying them into
 * the text channel only to parse them back out would be a lie about what kind
 * of thing they are. They ride in `priorPose`.
