 * The intra-value diff, which is the whole point of round 2.

 * Round 1 could say a field *changed*. It could not say what about it changed,
 * because the only thing a primitive carried was one `state` enum — so the
 * loudest mark available was a strike through the whole old value. A reader of
 * `git diff` never accepts that: on a delete+insert pair GitHub tokenizes both
 * sides and highlights the tokens that actually differ, layered on top of the
 * line-level red and green. `run_inference` → `run_predict` should put ink on
 * `inference` and `predict`, not on `run_`.
 *
 * This module is that tokenizer and that alignment, and nothing else. It has no
 * React, no DOM and no colour in it: it answers which runs of two strings are
 * shared and which are not, and the paint layer decides what that looks like.
