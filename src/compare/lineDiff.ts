/**
 * The Code tab: an ordinary git-style line diff over the raw records.
 *
 * This exists for exactly one reason, and it is Zach's: *"helpful to make sure
 * it's parsing correctly."* The Properties table is an interpretation — it says
 * a port was inserted, a title was renamed. The Code tab is the evidence that
 * interpretation was computed from, in the form every engineer already audits
 * without being taught: red line removed, green line added, unchanged lines as
 * context. If the table and the code ever disagree, the code is right and the
 * projector has a bug.
 *
 * Figma's own Compare panel does the same thing one level up — its Code tab
 * shows the selected layer's CSS with `- background: #FDBEAD;` above
 * `+ background: #FDCAAD;` — and Camunda ships an XML text view beside its
 * visual diff for the same purpose. Raw evidence one click below the meaning,
 * never merged into it.
 *
 * Note the deliberate asymmetry with `wordDiff`: this is a TWO-state diff, and
 * correctly so. Lines have no identity across the two sides, so "line 4 was
 * modified" is not a fact the data supports — it is a rendering of an adjacent
 * remove/add pair. That is the same reason token diffing needs only two states,
 * and the reason object diffing needs three lives in `compareModel.ts`.
