/**
 * The row model behind the property table, ported from the omnibox variant.
 *
 * The `PropertyRow` union below, and the three accessors under it, are that
 * variant's `src/review/boardDiff.ts` verbatim — it is the model Zach picked
 * when he compared the five, and the discriminated union is the load-bearing
 * part: `added` has no `previous` KEY AT ALL, so "the value it used to have"
 * cannot be typed, let alone rendered. The three-state model enforced by the
 * compiler instead of by a convention.
 *
 * WHY the union is copied but its producer is not: omnibox computes these rows
 * from a hardcoded fixture (`reviewFixture.ts` — a demo with canned versions).
 * This track diffs REAL boards read off disk through `compareSource.ts`.
 * Importing omnibox's producer would have swapped live evidence for a mock, so
 * only the row SHAPE crossed over and `propertyRowsOf` below is the adapter
 * that feeds it from this tree's real `CompareChange`. The praised table and
 * the real data both survive; neither one had to win.
